The need for a Lingua Franca is as old as human kind. Especially in large projects, a universal language is essential.

The business world knows English as its lingua franca, calculus is the language of physics, and UML is the lingua franca of software engineers.

UML 2 is much better than UML 1 because it allows hierarchical/recursive decomposition of large structures, including those that describe behaviour.

Behaviour and structure can be combined effectively.
