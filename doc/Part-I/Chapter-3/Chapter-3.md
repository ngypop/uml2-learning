# 3. UML Certification
The OMG's certification program exists since UML 2.

## Purpose
The purpose of a certificate is to prove how well the holder understands the UML. The certificate titled "OMG Certified UML Professional" (OCUP) features three levels: *Fundamental*, *Intermediate*, and *Advanced*. The contents of the program are scoped towards notation and rules, while processes are deliberately kept out of scope.

## The three certificates and the meta model
The three levels of the certificate represent the three layers of the UML (compliance levels). A certification is not easy, even for experienced UML practitioners. The theoretical understanding of UML is not required for practice, but can prove to be useful. Higher levels of certification allow the creation of a consistent complete model. UML konwledge alone does not make a good developer. Particularly, skills in the areas of analysis and design, programming languages and requirements engineering are required in addition.

## Certification levels
The three levels build upon each other.

### Fundamental level
Basic knowledge of the UML meta model and creation of simple diagrams.

### Intermediate level
Additional diagrams, action semantic language (partial), profiles.

### Advanced level
Complex notation elements, complete action semantic language, Object Constraint Language, UML infrastructure specification, architecture of the UML.

## Examination
The exam contains no questions on the use of UML, it is in the English language.
