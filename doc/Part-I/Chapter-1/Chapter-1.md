# Chapter 1: UML 2 â€“ Retrospect, Introspect und Prospect
UML is today the most widely used notation for the analysis and design of software systems.

The introduction of UML 2 in 2005 was a dramatic evolutionary step. Since then, until today's version 2.2, there have been mainly corrections.

## 1.1 What is UML?
A domain-specific langugae for the modeling, documentation, specification, and visualisation of complex software systems.

## 1.2 What is UML not?
It is not a programming language, it lacks formality, completeness, consistency. This means that it accompanies textual descriptions, but does not fully replace them.

UML is also not a process model that does not prescribe the way it is to be used.

## 1.3 The history of UML
UML has its origins in the early 90s, where different object oriented modeling methodologies competed for prevalence. They were contradictory and the absence of agreement made their use ineffective.

Around the year 2000, different approaches were unified into UML 1.0 and soon after UML 1.1. Large corporations like IBM were part of the work group of the OMG.

The first decade of 2000 was marked by the introduction of a powerful textual notation called Metadata Interchange Format (XMI), further improvements on semantics and alignment with the UML Metamodel. It climaxed in the 2005 release of UML 2.

UML 2.2 was released in 2009.

## 1.4 Why a new UML version? The requirements on UML 2.
Compared to UML 1, UML 2 has been simplified. Unpopular, poorly defined, and implementation-specific elements have been removed.

In comparison to UML 1, UML 2 uses OCL (object constraint language) and allows the reuse of basic constructs. It features stronger relationships between static and dynamic diagrams, integrates proven concepts like petri nets, and supports the modeing of large and complex systems by means of different hierarchical concepts.

Two mutually complementary documents form the specification of UML:
  - **Infrastructure**: basic language constructs
  - **Superstructure**: Diagram notation and semantics

## 1.5 Diagram languages in UML 2
UML 2 features the following novelties in terms of diagrams:
- 13 diagram types
- Novelties:
    - Activity diagrams are now extended petri nets
    - Tabular notation of behaviour as an alternative to diagrams
    - Previous collaboration diagram is now called communication diagram
    - Sequence diagram can be structured and decomposed
    - Deployment diagram reworked
    - Composite structure diagram newly introduced
    - Timing diagrams newly introduced
    - Interaction overview diagrams newly introduced
    - Component diagram reworked
    - State diagrams allow better connection to static elements
    - Introduction of protocol state machines

# 1.6 Requirements met?
The new version is more compact and consistent. However, the UML 2 superstructure still contains gaps.
