# 2. Procedure recommendations
There are many ways to appraoch a software project and there is plenty of literature out there that cover all of them. The right procedure strongly depends on the task, thus this book cannot make any recommendations for procedures and also does not follow any.

## 2.1 Making knowledge explicit
Once written down, concepts become clear and can be shared. This book helps with the task to put ideas, thoughts, concepts, solutions onto papaer sucht that they can be introduced to others and deliver the necessary material for discussions.

## 2.2 Procedure tips from UML practice
How to choose the right diagram type?
1. Check company-mandated diagram types
2. Who is my audience?
3. Which diagram type can capture the risks of my project?

### Diagrams and their application
| Diagram type | Central elements |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Class diagram                    | Classes and their mutual relationships. |
| Package diagram                  | Partitioning of a system to visualize organisation and dependencies. |
| Object diagram                   | Structural snapshot. Resolves quantity ratios. |
| Composite structure diagram      | Inner life of a  class, component, system part. Parts of the whole and quantity ratios. |
| Component diagram                | Grouping of classes into reusable components. Relationships and interfaces between components. |
| Deployment diagram               | Environment of use of the system. Deployment of components at runtime. |
| Use case diagramm                | What the system offers its environment. External view, context delimination. |
| Activity diagram                 | Flow of a flow-oriented process. |
| State machine                    | States of an interface, use case, object, etc. |
| Sequence diagram                 | Exchange of information in sequence. Temporal flow with communication partners. |
| Communication diagram            | Who communicates with whom? Collaboration within the system. |
| Timing diagramm                  | State, in wich different interaction partners are. Shows precise temporal behaviour. |
| Interaction overview diagram     | When which interaction happens. Connection between Interaction diagrams (sequence-, communication- and timing diagrams). |
